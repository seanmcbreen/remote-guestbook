    Open in

        Open in Cloud Code
    </a>

<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>
    With a single click [well set of them] I can:
    <ul>
        <li> Open Visual Studio Code
        <li> Clone a specified Git repo
        <li> Have that recommend 'remote development'
        <li> Have that configure the 'remote machine'
        <li> Start working...
    </ul>

    <h2>How did it Happen</h2>
    VS Code has a feature called 'remote development' which allows the front end to connect to a remote back-end
    for all the tools engine tasks. For instance this covers:

    <ul>
        <li>File system
        <li>Extensions
        <li>Code Indexing
        <li>Language Services
        <li>Terminal
        <li>Debuggers
        <li>Developer Tool Chain
    </ul>

    The remote machine can either be pre-configured and you SSH into it e.g. Cloud Shell. Or you can dynamically create
    a Docker image (or download one). In this case I used a docker image which installs:
    <ul>
        <li>Latest node:lts image
        <li>The cloud code and docker extensions
        <li>Adds npm, typescript and tslint
        <li>Installs git
        <li>installs Docker CE
        <li>installs GCloud and kubectl
        <li>Installs skaffold
        <li>Installs helm
    </ul>
    ... as a result the user simply connects to GCP (via gcloud init) and everything just works.
